# Stock Trading Simulator

## Introduction
The website is a trading simulator that replicates a real trading platform, allowing beginner traders to learn about trading in a risk-free environment.

## Features
• Search and view stocks’ financial news, performance summary and technical charts for analysis.
• Upon creating an account, users will be allocated a default amount of virtual money, which they can use to simulate buying and selling stocks.
• Users are able to manage their portfolio (i.e, to buy more / sell the stocks purchased) and review their trading history to better plan their subsequent trades.
